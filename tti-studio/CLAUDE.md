# The Tech Intern — Video Studio

> **NEW SESSION? READ THESE IN ORDER:**
>
> 1. **`docs/WORKFLOW.md`** — ⭐ **THE EPISODE PRODUCTION PROCESS.**
>    The 7 phases (topic → outline → deck → validate → script → render → deliver),
>    the gates between them, the per-episode folder structure. **Follow this
>    every time. Don't deviate.** Deviations cost hours and trigger
>    "we already did this differently last time" feedback from the user.
> 2. **`docs/BRAND.md`** — audience, voice/tone, exact palette & fonts.
> 3. **`docs/STYLE.md`** — the motion-graphics style (living bg, wipes,
>    breathing, building diagrams). The rule that keeps videos from looking
>    like slides.
> 4. **`docs/PIPELINE.md`** — HyperFrames render technical details: commands,
>    gotchas, asset paths, compression + delivery.
> 5. **`docs/CURRICULUM.md`** — the 30-episode AI Season 1 plan + future
>    seasons (system design, DevOps, security) + the teaching discipline.
> 6. **`docs/LOCAL-SETUP.md`** — if running Claude Code on a laptop (vs. the
>    cloud sandbox): how to set up the local env, MCP servers (ElevenLabs),
>    and the hybrid cloud-vs-local workflow. The cloud sandbox firewall
>    blocks external APIs like ElevenLabs — those steps run locally.
>
> **TL;DR of the channel:** *The Tech Intern* — faceless, beginner-first tech

> `#FF6B2C` on cream `#FAF8F3`. Infographic/motion-graphics style, **never**
> slideshow, **never** cinematic AI b-roll. Reference episodes:

>
> **All episode files live in `episodes/epNN/`.** Never put episode files in

# HyperFrames Composition Project

## Skills — USE THESE FIRST

**Always invoke the relevant skill before writing or modifying compositions.** Skills encode framework-specific patterns (e.g., `window.__timelines` registration, `data-*` attribute semantics, shader-compatible CSS rules) that are NOT in generic web docs. Skipping them produces broken compositions.

**Doing anything with HyperFrames?** Start at `/hyperframes` — it tells you what HyperFrames can do and which skill or workflow handles your intent (make a video, TTS / BGM, prep footage, author / animate, render, install blocks), and routes every "make me a video" request to the right workflow. Read it first, especially when there's no project context to orient you. The video workflows it routes to:

- `/product-launch-video` — a **product** URL or brief / script → 60-90s product launch / SaaS / promo video.
- `/website-to-video` — a **general** website / URL → a video _of_ the site (tour / showcase / social clip from captured visuals); a product **launch / promo** is `/product-launch-video`.
- `/faceless-explainer` — arbitrary text (topic / article / notes), **no URL, no website capture** → 60-90s faceless explainer.
- `/embedded-captions` — an existing talking-head video (MP4) → the same footage with captions / subtitles added (rail + embed, or pure-cinematic embed); the footage itself is untouched.
- `/graphic-overlays` — an existing talking-head / interview / podcast video (MP4) → the same footage **packaged with designed graphic overlays** (kinetic titles, lower-thirds, data callouts, pull-quotes, side panels, pip) synced to the transcript; the clip plays unchanged underneath. (Plain captions/subtitles → `/embedded-captions`.)
- `/pr-to-video` — a GitHub PR (URL / `owner/repo#N` / "this PR") → 30-90s code-change explainer (changelog / feature reveal / fix / refactor).
- `/motion-graphics` — a short (typically under 10s) design-led **motion graphic**, motion-is-the-message, no narration: kinetic type, a stat / number count-up, a chart, a logo sting, a lower-third / overlay, or an animated tweet / headline / captured-page highlight; rendered to MP4 or a transparent overlay. Longer / narrated / custom → `/general-video`.
- `/general-video` — fallback for any other video (title card, longer brand / sizzle reel, multi-scene montage, static loop, custom composition); the original hyperframes authoring flow, any length.

**Porting an existing composition?** `/remotion-to-hyperframes` translates a Remotion (React) composition into HyperFrames HTML — a source migration, separate from the creation workflows above.

The domain skills (`/hyperframes-core`, `/hyperframes-animation`, `/hyperframes-creative`, `/hyperframes-cli`, `/hyperframes-media`, `/hyperframes-registry`) and the full capability map live inside `/hyperframes` — it is the single source of truth for which skill handles which intent.

> **Tailwind v4 projects** (`hyperframes init --tailwind`): see `/hyperframes-core` → `references/tailwind.md`.

> **Skills not available or need updating?** Run `npx skills add heygen-com/hyperframes`
> and restart the agent session so the new skills load.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # start the preview server (long-running — keep it alive in background)
npm run check        # lint + validate + inspect
npm run render       # render to MP4
npm run publish      # publish and get a shareable link
npx hyperframes lint --verbose  # include info-level findings
npx hyperframes lint --json     # machine-readable output for CI
npx hyperframes docs <topic> # reference docs in terminal
```

> **`npm run dev` is a long-running server, not a one-shot command.** It blocks until stopped.
> In Claude Code, always run it with `run_in_background: true`. Never run it as a foreground
> command — it will time out and the server will die, breaking the browser preview.

## Documentation

**For quick reference**, use the local CLI docs command (no network required):

```bash
npx hyperframes docs <topic>
```

Topics: `data-attributes`, `gsap`, `compositions`, `rendering`, `examples`, `troubleshooting`

**For full documentation**, discover pages via the machine-readable index — do NOT guess URLs:

```
https://hyperframes.heygen.com/llms.txt
```

## Project Structure

- `index.html` — main composition (root timeline)
- `compositions/` — sub-compositions referenced via `data-composition-src`
- `meta.json` — project metadata (id, name)
- `transcript.json` — whisper word-level transcript (if generated)

## Linting — ALWAYS RUN AFTER CHANGES

After creating or editing any `.html` composition, **always** run the full check before considering the task complete:

```bash
npm run check
```

Fix all errors before presenting the result. Inspect warnings should be reviewed before rendering.

## Key Rules

1. Every timed element needs `data-start`, `data-duration`, and `data-track-index`
2. Elements with timing **MUST** have `class="clip"` — the framework uses this for visibility control
3. Timelines must be paused and registered on `window.__timelines`:
   ```js
   window.__timelines = window.__timelines || {};
   window.__timelines["composition-id"] = gsap.timeline({ paused: true });
   ```
4. Videos use `muted` with a separate `<audio>` element for the audio track
5. Sub-compositions use `data-composition-src="compositions/file.html"` to reference other HTML files
6. Only deterministic logic — no `Date.now()`, no `Math.random()`, no network fetches
